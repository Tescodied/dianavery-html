                    <h2>Why Choose a British Shorthair?</h2>
                    <p>
                        British Shorthair cats are a beautiful, calm, balanced, and affectionate breed that brings joy to any home. 
                        They are known for being intelligent and adaptable, making them a good fit for various households. 
                        With their signature massive round head, wide cheeks, and large, open eyes, they are often referred to as Teddy Bears. 
                        These cats are generally in good health and have a long lifespan. 
                        Incredibly, a lady's British Shorthair cat in UK died at the age of 32.

                <div class="faq-wrapper">
                    <h2>Are the British Shorthair Hypoallergenic?</h2>
                    <p>
                        No, British Shorthair cats are not hypoallergenic. 
                        They shed as much as other cats and produce similar amounts of allergens. 
                        While no cat is truly hypoallergenic, some breeds produce lower levels of allergy-triggering proteins, but this varies greatly by individual cat.

                <div class="faq-wrapper">
                    <h2>How Much Does a Kitten Cost?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The price of a British Shorthair Kitten can vary depending on several factors, such as colour and pattern, the kitten's background, the reputation of the breeder, etc. Rarer or more popular colours potentially cost more. 
                        <br>
                        At Dianavery, all kittens are fully vaccinated, dewormed, and microchipped before leaving us, usually around 13 - 14 weeks old.
                        Our prices are always fair and reasonable. 
                        Feel free to contact us to find out more. 
                        Beware of backyard breeders who offer kittens without paperwork, without vaccinations or microchips, and usually under 12 weeks of age. These kittens are often fed low-quality food, lack proper veterinary care, and may have health problems in the future.

                <div class="faq-wrapper">
                    <h2>Is There Any Special Maintenance with a British Shorthair?</h2>
                    <p>
                        British Shorthair cats are generally low-maintenance, but they do require regular grooming to maintain their dense, plush coat and prevent matting and hairballs. 
                        Their thick coats require weekly brushing, and more often during shedding seasons.

                    <h2>Do You Ship? How Much?</h2>
                    <p>Yes, we ship worldwide. For Europe, we use licensed couriers, and for other continents, we partner with PetAir. Please contact us for specific costs and arrangements.</p>

                    <h2>How Are Their Personalities? Do They Get Along with Children and Other Pets?</h2>
                    <p>
                        British Shorthairs are even-tempered, loyal, and affectionate. 
                        They enjoy playing but don't demand constant attention. 
                        They get along well with other pets and children who respect their space, making them a great addition to families.

                <div class="faq-wrapper">
                    <h2>How Do I Know I Have Found a Good Ethical Breeder?</h2>
                    <p>
                        A good ethical breeder prioritises the health and well-being of his cats and kittens. 
                        <br>
                        An Ethical breeder is not solely driven by profit. They invests time, money, and effort into his breeding program and the well-being of his cats. 
                        He will be knowledgeable about the breed, transparent about his breeding practices, and will be available to support you after purchase.
                        <br>
                        Look for transparency and professionalism; ask to see the kittens in their home or arrange a video call. Look for signs like health testing and a clean environment.
                    </p>

                <div class="faq-wrapper">
                    <h2>Do British Shorthairs like to sit on your lap?</h2>
                    <p>
                        No, not too much. Some of this may be breed personality. Some may be that with their dense coat, they get over-heated sitting on us warm humans. 
                        A coaxed British Shorthair will make itself comfortable for a while; a forced British Shorthair will flat out refuse.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-wrapper">
                    <h2>Do British Shorthairs like to be hugged and carried like a baby?</h2>
                    <p>
                        No. A British likes to be around you and by you. They will follow you, watch you and basically supervise all aspects of life in their house. 
                        They simply do not like to be "controlled". Being a larger heavy cat, they feel very uncomfortable off the ground.
